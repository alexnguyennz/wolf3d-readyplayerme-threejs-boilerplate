Wolf 3D Ready Player Me
===================

Slightly updated and vanilla version of the [wolf3d-readyplayerme-threejs-boilerplate](https://github.com/egemenertugrul/wolf3d-readyplayerme-threejs-boilerplate) to display [Wolf3D/ReadyPlayer.Me](https://readyplayer.me/) avatars with three.js which should work with newer half-body avatars.
